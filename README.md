# Rainfall-Data-Analysis-Visualization

## DAV PROJECT

### Objective ⭐

This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of state-wise maximum annual rainfall in India. It involves preprocessing, analyzing, and visualizing the dataset to extract meaningful insights. The main objectives of this project are:

- Analysis of state-wise maximum annual rainfall.
- Visualization of state-wise maximum annual rainfall.
- Visualization of annual rainfall for all states in 2010.
- Visualizing annual rainfall across states for a specific year.
- Random and systematic sampling of annual rainfall data.
- Creating various plots and charts to visualize the data.

### Dataset Information ⭐

The dataset used in this project includes annual rainfall data from 1901 to 2019 for different states in India.
